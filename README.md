# FurACalc

Trial in setting up a Flutter App using the Flet Package currently available for python.
At the moment in can load images and tables but since the package does not allow for interactive charting it is currently on hold.

The idea would be to provide a app that can interact with images of Fura2 Recordings, extract the cells via segmentation and trace the segmented area signal
over time.
